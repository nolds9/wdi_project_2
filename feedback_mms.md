# Feedback from Matt (mms)

## Overview

Great first impression.  App is clean and sharp.  Code looks good.  I am impressed with your classwork, your attitude, your interaction with your peers, and your projects.  I would recommend you for hire today.  That said, I do think the practices you will learn over the next weeks will help polish.  I wish I had this kind of time again to focus on my growing my craft.

Good job keeping your scope achievable.  Code is organized and formatted well.  Items have a single responsibility.  You progressed smoothly, got your MVP working early, and took the time to review and improve. Excellent!

Full disclosure: we have to time-box project reviews. There was no way for me to get to all of this.  I expect my commments will be helpful.  Feel free to ask specific questions.

## Project Workflow: How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?

Meets Expectations.  Awesome readme and planning files.  Your commits show a good progression and comments are clear and helpful.

Readme is missing installation instructions.  'rails-erd' requires separate, manually 'graphviz' installation.  Some seed data would help too.

I find it interesting that your second commit installed materialize, before you even had a basic page working. I was happy to see you deployed early (and often?).


## Technical Requirements: How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?

Exceeds Expectations.  Good solid coding.  You've got a pile of additional gems in your Gemfile.  I recommend you organize these, to make it easier to find later.  I prefer alphabetical, within each group.  It's simple, clear, an unequivocal.

## Creativity / Interface: How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?

Exceeds Expectations: Enjoyable, pleasant experience.  Information is well organized and carefully presented.  

## Code Quality: How able would an uninformed programmer be to reuse and extend your code?

Meets Expectations: Code is organized and formatted well.  Items have a single responsibility.  You are following Rails conventions.

## Deployment and Functionality: How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?

Exceed Expectations: It looks and feels like any app I would see after one week of development.  Scratch that - has more functionality than many one week old apps.  

Most of the images are not working.  It looks like you are storing the image information with the course.  Maybe, the path is just wrong?  The "system/courses" portion of this looks wrong, but I'd have to review a little more about assets and Heroku: http://assembly-general.herokuapp.com/system/courses/images/000/000/002/original/html-css-js.jpg?1439212257

## Conclusion

A solid project.  You are pushing yourself and adding to what you brought to this class.  Nice work.
